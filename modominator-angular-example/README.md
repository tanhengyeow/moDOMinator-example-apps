# modominator-react-example (custom)

This example uses [moDOMinator-chrome-extension](https://github.com/tanhengyeow/moDOMinator-chrome-extension) as a custom tool to scan for web vulnerabilities.

New DOM elements that are rendered will be scanned for web vulnerabilities. Web vulnerablities that succeed will be reported in the browser console or shown as a browser alert.

TODO: Save the alerts in the browser extension UI.
